		<p style="background-color:		#b94646;">Varanasi , once known as Benares or Banaras and Kashi, is a historical city in northern India. The city is sacred to Hindus and Jains and also one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with settlements dating back to the 11th century BC. Many Hindus believe that dying in Varanasi brings salvation/nirvana and so they make the trip to the city when they realize that they are close to death. For some, the culture shock of the burning corpses in plain view can be a bit overwhelming. However, the scene of pilgrims doing their devotions in the River Ganga at sunrise set against the backdrop of the centuries old temples is probably one of the most impressive sights in the world.

The city can be scorchingly hot in the summer months so, if possible, time your visit to fall between October and March, and bring something warm to wear for chilly days and nights.</p>

		<p>The Idea of a Hindu University was made known to the world by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji at a meeting held in 1904 at Varanasi under the Presidentship of his Highness Maharaja Sir Prabhu Narayan Singh of Varanasi. A prospectus of the University was published and circulated in October, 1905 and it was discussed at a select Meeting held in the Town Hall of Varanasi on the 31st December, 1905 at which a number of distinguished educationists and representatives of the Hindu community of almost every Province at India were present. The meeting appointed a Provisional Committee to give a final shape to the prospectus and to promote the scheme. The Congress of Hindu Religion (Sanatan Dharma Mahasabha) which met at Allahabad in January 1906, during the Kumbh fair, under the presidentship of Jagadguru Sri Sankaracharya of Govardhan Math also considered and approved the scheme. The Congress further appointed a Committee with Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji as its Secretary to take necessary steps to give effect to the scheme of the University. At the sacred Sangam (confluence of the three holy rivers, Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati at Prayag) Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji took a vow to dedicate his life for the establishment of the proposed University. The first prospectus along with the resolutions passed by the Sanatan Dharma Mahasabha was issued to the general public on March 12, 1906. Though the scheme met with Instant approval and support from the press and the public, owing to the unfavourable political atmosphere in the country, an organized endeavour to carry out the proposal had to be put off for a couple of years. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji, realizing that it was too a great project to be taken up alongwith his profession, gave up his lucrative practice at the Bar and launched his mission in January, 1911.</p><hr>
